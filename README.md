Next.Data.gov
==============
We built Next.Data.Gov using new tools. This project tapped into two very active open source projects: WordPress and CKAN. The content and community sections of Next.Data.Gov are powered by WordPress. The data catalog is powered by CKAN. 

This repository contains the HTML and WordPress template files for the content and community sections.
