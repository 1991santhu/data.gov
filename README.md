Next.Data.gov
==============
We built [Next.Data.gov](http://next.data.gov) using new tools. This project tapped into two very active open source projects: [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [CKAN](http://ckan.org). The content and community sections of Next.Data.gov are powered by WordPress. The data catalog is powered by CKAN. 

This repository contains the HTML and WordPress template files for the content and community sections. The repository for the CKAN extensions will be published shortly.

##HTML

This directory contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that embodies the design for Next.Data.gov.
